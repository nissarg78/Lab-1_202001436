<h2> Question-1 : Identify FRs and NFRs </h2>
<br>
<br>
The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the
field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also
includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by
the institution.
As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to
develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the
institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting
at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing
if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system
aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has
administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into
the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is
taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books
online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.
The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should
run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a
large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in
plain text.

<h3>FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF LIS SYSTEM:</h3>
<li>The system should have Sign-in and Sign-up options. <br>
<li>Login for staff members should be different. <br>
<li>User can able to search books by name of book or name of author or publisher. <br>
<li>There should be feature for storing data of issuing. <br>
<li>There should be a feature to prebook any book which is already taken by someone. <br>
<li>There should be a feature which will allow user to extend the deadline of book if there is no prebooking.<br>
<li>There should be a feature of adding new books or removing books. <br>
<li>There should be a feature which will notify user before a day of deadline.<br>
<li>There should be a feature that adds charge in case of overdue.<br>
<li>There should be a database that takes record of issuing and returning.<br>

<h3>NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF LIS SYSTEM:</h3>
<li>The system should be working 24X7.<br>
<li>System should be able to perform tasks in certain amount of time.<br>
<li>The system should be reliable and can't have single failure problem.<br>
<li>The system should be secure that issuing and returning can only be done by admins.<br>
<li>The system should be scalable that it can handle huge numbers of users.<br>
<li>The system should be easy to maintain.<br>

<br>
<h2> Question-2 : Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.</h2>
<br>
Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from
disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that
addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to
recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies,
where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized
for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.
<br>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<li>This mobile application is basically assist hearing for deaf and partially deaf people.<br>
<li>This is for any group of age.<br>
<br>
<h3>Features</h3>
<br>
<li>There should be a feature of vibration that invoke whenever the AI detects any significant voice that may concern the user.<br>
<li>Knowing that sign language is used as a communication tool for the deaf, technology should help those who are unable to understand sign language by translating it into a form that can be easily understood. If a suitable medium of communication, such as a mobile phone, is available, this will make it easier for them to interact with others. This will assist in removing obstacles encountered when hearing-impaired people communicate with hearing people.<br>
<li>The user shoul be able to change vibration patterns according to their priorities.<br>
<li>There should be a perticular pattern of vibration that is assigned for emergency.<br>
<li>The application should run both online and offline.<br>
<li>The application should be sensitive enough to identify the noise signals.<br>
<br>
<h3>Nonfunctional requirement</h3>
<br>
<li>It should be easily affordable for all groups of people.<br>
<li>There should be usage of advanced sensors to enhance the perfomance.<br>
<li>It should be easily accessible to all.<br>
<li>Application should be scalable.<br>
<li>The latency of application should be as minimal as possible.<br>
